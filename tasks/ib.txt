Member B — Executor & Built-in Registry (lead: command dispatch)

Modules: exec.rs, errors.rs, builtins/mod.rs

Command dispatch:

Look up command name in built-ins map.

If not found → Command '<name>' not found.

Run built-in, update ShellState.last_status, return to prompt after completion.

Error model:

Define ShellError with Display mapping OS errors to human messages.

Standardize exit codes (0 success, 1 generic error, 2 usage).

Extensibility:

Register all built-ins once in builtins::registry().

Interfaces:

pub enum ShellError {
    Io(std::io::Error),
    Usage(&'static str),
    NotFound(String),
    // … (permission, not a directory, etc.)
}

pub fn execute(cmd: Command, sh: &mut ShellState, registry: &BuiltinRegistry) -> i32;

pub struct BuiltinRegistry {
    map: std::collections::HashMap<&'static str, Box<dyn Builtin + Send + Sync>>
}


Acceptance tests:

Known command runs; unknown prints exact message.

Exit codes are captured into sh.last_status.
