Noor — File Ops II (cat, cp, mv) + Polishing (colors)

Modules: builtins/cat.rs, cp.rs, mv.rs, color.rs

cat [files…]:

Stream each file to stdout; - means stdin (optional).

cp SRC DST:

File→file and file→dir; copy bytes, preserve mode (bonus).

mv SRC DST:

Try rename; if EXDEV (cross-fs), fallback to copy+remove.

Color (bonus):

Optional colorized output for ls & errors based on file type.

Acceptance tests:

cat prints file contents; nonexistent prints error, continues to next file.

cp then cmp-like byte equality (unit test).

mv within same fs via rename, across fs via copy+remove.
