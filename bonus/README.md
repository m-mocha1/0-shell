# Bonus Features for Shell Project

This folder contains implementations and documentation for the following bonus features:

- Handle Ctrl+C (SIGINT) without crashing the shell
- Shell usability enhancements:
  - Auto-completion
  - Command history
  - Prompt with current directory (e.g., ~/projects/0-shell $)
  - Colorized output for commands, directories, and errors
- Command chaining with `;`
- Pipes (`|`)
- I/O redirection (`>`, `<`)
- Support for environment variables (e.g. `$HOME`, `$PATH`)
- A custom help command documenting built-in functionality

Each feature is implemented in a separate file for clarity.
